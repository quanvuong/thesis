  abstract = 	 {Entropy regularization is commonly used to improve policy optimization in reinforcement learning. It is believed to help with exploration by encouraging the selection of more stochastic policies. In this work, we analyze this claim using new visualizations of the optimization landscape based on randomly perturbing the loss function. We first show that even with access to the exact gradient, policy optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the objective function. We then qualitatively show that in some environments, a policy with higher entropy can make the optimization landscape smoother, thereby connecting local optima and enabling the use of larger learning rates. This paper presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape, shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and highlights the challenge of designing general-purpose policy optimization algorithms.}

abstract = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

@misc{paszke2019pytorch,
  abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but
not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals
are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming
style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent
with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient
and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
  In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of
PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every
aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its
user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key
components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling
performance.
  We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the
overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},
